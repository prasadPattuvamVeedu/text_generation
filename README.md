# text_generation
Text generation using RNN is a deep learning method where a Recurrent Neural Network learns sequential patterns in text and predicts the next word or character based on previous inputs. RNN maintains memory of past information, making it suitable for generating sentences, stories, and sequences by modeling language context step-by-step.
